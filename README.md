# ðŸ›’ Product Recommendation System using Supervised Machine Learning

This project builds a product recommendation system using several supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and more.

##  Overview

We use an e-commerce dataset (`merrec.csv`) to predict whether a user will "favorite" a product based on session and product features, then generate Top-N personalized recommendations.

##  Features

- Binary classification of user interactions
- Multiple ML models with evaluation metrics
- Top-N item recommendations for users
- Visualizations: confusion matrices, metric comparisons, and recommendation scores

##  Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

##  Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix
